1.//app folder:
The new app directory in Next.js 13 works alongside the pages directory to support incremental adoption. It provides much more flexibility to configure our UI. The app directory introduces the concepts of layouts, error components, and loading components while also leveraging Reactâ€™s server components for building the UI. The UI for a particular route is defined by a page.jsx file inside of the folder. Therefore, a folder structure that looks like app/profile/settings/page.jsx will take care of rendering the /profile/settings route.
2.//node_modules:
The node_modules folder is where all the dependencies of your project are installed. When you run npm install, npm looks at the dependencies listed in package.json and installs them in the node_modules folder.
3.//public folder:
The public folder is where you can put your static files like images, CSS, Google Site Verification, robots.txt, favicon.ico, etc. Next.js can serve static files under a folder called public in the root directory. Files inside public can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (/)
4.//eslintrc.json:
The **.eslintrc.json** file is used to configure **ESLint** for your Next.js project. ESLint is a tool that helps you find and fix problems in your code. Next.js provides some built-in ESLint configurations that you can choose when you create a new project or run `next lint`.
5.//gitignore:
The **.gitignore** file is used to tell **Git** which files or folders to ignore in your Next.js project. This can help you avoid uploading unnecessary or sensitive files to your GitHub repository. For example, you may want to ignore the **.next** folder, which contains the build output of your project, or the **.env** file, which contains environment variables. You can create or edit the **.gitignore** file in the root of your project and list the files or folders that you want to exclude.

6.//jsconfig.json:
The **jsconfig.json** file is used to configure **JavaScript** features for your Next.js project. One of the features is **module path aliases**, which allows you to import modules using absolute paths instead of relative paths. For example, you can import a component from `components/Button.js` as `import Button from 'components/Button'` instead of `import Button from '../../components/Button'`. To use this feature, you need to set the **baseUrl** and **paths** options in the **jsconfig.json** file.
7.//next.config.js:
The **next.config.js** file is used to customize the **Next.js** configuration for your project. You can use it to change the default behavior or add new features to Next.js. For example, you can use it to set the **basePath**, **i18n**, **rewrites**, **headers**, **env** and other options. The **next.config.js** file is a regular Node.js module, not a JSON file, and it is only used by the Next.js server and build phases.
9.//package-lock.json:
The **package-lock.json** file is used to lock the versions of the **npm** packages that you install for your Next.js project. It helps you ensure that you get the same versions of the packages every time you run `npm install`, regardless of any updates or changes in the package registry. You should commit the **package-lock.json** file to your version control system, such as Git, to keep track of the changes in your dependencies. If you need to clean up or update the **package-lock.json** file, you can delete it and the **node_modules** folder and run `npm install` again.
10.//package.json:
The **package.json** file is used to define the **metadata** and **dependencies** of your Next.js project. It contains information such as the name, version, description, scripts, and license of your project. It also lists the packages that you need to run and develop your project, such as Next.js, React, React DOM, and ESLint. You can use the **package.json** file to run commands such as `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, or `npm run start`. The **package.json** file is located in the root of your project directory (next to next.config.js). 
11.//postcss.config.js:
The **postcss.config.js** file is used to customize the **PostCSS** configuration for your Next.js project. PostCSS is a tool that transforms CSS with plugins, such as adding vendor prefixes, using future CSS syntax, or optimizing the output. You can create a **postcss.config.js** file in the root of your project and specify the plugins that you want to use. For example, you can use **postcss-preset-env** to enable features such as custom media queries, custom selectors, or nesting rules. You can also use **postcss-import** to import CSS files from other modules. 
12.//tailwind.config.js:
The **tailwind.config.js** file is used to customize the **Tailwind CSS** configuration for your Next.js project. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that works exceptionally well with Next.js. You can use the **tailwind.config.js** file to change the default theme, add custom colors, fonts, breakpoints, or plugins, or enable features such as dark mode or JIT mode. You can also use the **purge** option to remove unused CSS classes from your production build. To create a **tailwind.config.js** file, you can run `npx tailwindcss init` in the root of your project.
